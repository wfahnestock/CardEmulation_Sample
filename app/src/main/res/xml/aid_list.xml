    If category="payment" is used for any aid-groups, you must also add an android:apduServiceBanner
    attribute above, like so:
    android:apduServiceBanner="@drawable/settings_banner"
     apduServiceBanner should be 260x96 dp. In pixels, that works out to...
       - drawable-xxhdpi: 780x288 px
       - drawable-xhdpi:  520x192 px
       - drawable-hdpi:   390x144 px
       - drawable-mdpi:   260x96  px
    The apduServiceBanner is displayed in the "Tap & Pay" menu in the system Settings app, and
    is only displayed for apps which implement the "payment" AID category.
    Since this sample is implementing a non-standard card type (a loyalty card, specifically), we
    do not need to define a banner.
    Important: category="payment" should only be used for industry-standard payment cards. If you are
        implementing a closed-loop payment system (e.g. stored value cards for a specific merchant
        or transit system), use category="other". This is because only one "payment" card may be
        active at a time, whereas all "other" cards are active simultaneously (subject to AID
        dispatch).
